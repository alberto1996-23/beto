      <p>  Hiya! My name is Alberto Williams(They/them). I am an aspiring
           software developer student at The Ohio State University! I am 
           majoring in computer science and engineering to do full stack
           web development, as well as mobile development. Additionally,
           I will be taking a minor in cybersecurity, so I can possibly
           get a certificate in that field! 
      </p>
      <p>Born in ‘96, the age of technology began to take root. My first 
        exposure and enjoyment of technology were video games. I loved playing 
        video games such as Super Mario 64, The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, 
        and various Pokémon titles. These games sparked both my love for technology, 
        curiosity for software, and imagination. In 2007, my father finally got our 
        home a desktop computer. Born and raised in an impoverished environment, my family
        was not able to afford the most up-to-date computer, so just having a computer at 
        home was a huge blessing. Through the home computer was how I learned of the many 
        websites widely used today such as Facebook and Google, as well as relics of that 
        time such as MySpace. As I grew up with these websites, I witnessed the evolution 
        of their user-interfaces and user-experiences, going from basic HTML and CSS to more 
        sophisticated software development technologies. I would consider myself a “kid raised 
        by technology”, and it was this technological nurture which birthed a desire to assume 
        a career in computers; specifically, in software engineering.
